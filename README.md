# MovieLens Data Analysis
---
## Introduction:
Welcome to the MovieLens Data Analysis project! This project aims to build an end-to-end pipeline  to analyze and derive insights from the MovieLens dataset using modern data engineering and analytics techniques.

### Overview:
The MovieLens dataset provides a rich collection of movies and ratings data, making it an ideal resource for exploring trends and patterns in the world of cinema. In this project, we leverage various technologies and tools to ingest, process, analyze, and visualize this data.
You can find more details about the used dataset from the following link.

### Key Components:

- Data Ingestion: We use Mage as a workflow orchestrator to perform batch processing of the MovieLens dataset. Python scripts are employed to fetch data from the MovieLens website and prepare it for further processing.

- Cloud Infrastructure: Terraform is utilized as an IaC tool to provision cloud resources on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) platform.

- Data Storage: The collected data is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets for storage and easy access.

- Data Warehousing: Google BigQuery is used as the data warehouse for storing and querying the dataset.
  
- Data Transformations: We employ dbt (data build tool) to transform and model the raw data into structured datasets suitable for analysis.

- Dashboard: Finally, we create interactive dashboards using the Google Data Studio visualization tool. These dashboards provide intuitive visualizations of key metrics and insights derived from the MovieLens dataset.

### Contributions:
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and expand the capabilities of this project. Whether you're interested in data engineering, cloud computing, analytics, or visualization, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved!
