Terraform Configuration
Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

Installation
To install Terraform, refer to the official Terraform installation guide.

Configuration
After installing Terraform, configure it by following these steps:

Update Configuration Files: Open the following files in your Terraform project directory and update them according to your environment:

main.tf: This file contains the main configuration for your infrastructure.
variables.tf: This file defines variables used in your Terraform configuration.
Update Credentials and Project Name: Ensure that the following values are updated in the variables.tf file to match your environment:

credential_json_path: Update this value with the path to your credential JSON file.
project_name: Update this value with your project name.
Execution
Once you've updated the configuration files, execute the following commands to apply your Terraform configuration:

terraform init: Initializes the Terraform configuration and downloads any necessary plugins.
terraform plan: Generates an execution plan showing what Terraform will do when you apply your configuration.
terraform apply: Applies your Terraform configuration, creating or modifying the infrastructure according to your configuration files.
