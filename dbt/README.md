Data transformation and modeling play a crucial role in every data project, as they lay the foundation for meaningful data analysis and insights extraction. Our project focuses on implementing proper transformations to consolidate data from multiple sources into a unified model, facilitating efficient analysis and decision-making.

The linear graph below illustrates the flow of our data model:

As depicted, we integrate data from three distinct sources and merge them into a single fact table through a series of transformations and joins. This consolidated fact table serves as the cornerstone of our data analysis pipeline and will be instrumental in the subsequent step of dashboard creation.

To explore the core and staging model in detail, please refer to the following link. Before proceeding, ensure to adapt the model's data sources to match your environment.
